	desc: `This was a fun little project for the 'Autonom - Collaboration' course, where I made a tiny drum kit that plays drum sounds each of which is mapped to an input sound with distinct texture. Here I used a self-soldered USB audio interface to grasp the sounds and timbreID library in Pure Data to cluster and map the sounds.`,
