	title: `A Visual Analysis Tool for Geolocation Inference Methods`,
	link: 'https://github.com/ohyeahbravo',
	desc: `In this thesis I developed a visual analytics tool that allows interactive exploration of
    the results from location inference methods for social media data. The primary aim
    of the tool is to provide deeper insights into how well the algorithms infer locations,
    beyond comparisons using conventional evaluation metrics such as error distances or
    accuracy. Its design invites users to follow an iterative process of visualizing, comparing
    and creating new sets with its interaction schemes. A dashboard layout is used to accom-
    modate various types of visualizations as widgets including the map and the n-gram
    chart.`,
