	desc: `For my master's thesis, I developed a visual analytics tool that allows interactive exploration of the results from location inference methods for social media data, especially tweets. The aim was to provide deeper insights into how well the algorithms work, beyond merely comparing numeric evaluation values. Widgets such as map and n-gram chart accommodates visualization to compare datasets. Its interaction scheme lets users to follow an iterative process of visualizing, comparing and creating new sets to explore the results.`,
